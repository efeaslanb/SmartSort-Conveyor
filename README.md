An Arduino-based conveyor that detects and sorts objects over 3 cm using an ultrasonic sensor, stepper motor, and micro servo. Built with low-cost materials and DFA principles for simple assembly.  

**Development:**  
- Ultrasonic sensor â†’ object detection  
- Stepper motor â†’ belt drive  
- Servo + popsicle stick â†’ sorting mechanism  
- Cardboard frame for low-cost prototyping  

**Challenges & Fixes:**  
- Power drops â†’ added supply module  
- Misaligned sorting â†’ re-positioned servo & guides  
- Inconsistent sensor readings â†’ adjusted placement  
- Weak frame â†’ reinforced cardboard joints  

**Learning:**  
Gained hands-on experience integrating sensors, motors, and power systems. Next version will use a SolidWorks-designed frame, soldered wiring, and a stronger motor/battery setup.
